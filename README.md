## Metro Manga

## 1. General information

This project is a personal project not available and not functional now, the database is missing as well as some images.  
I started this project to learn web development being before passionate about Japanese animation type "one piece" and now by this passionate web development project.  
I invite you to take a look at the code but I would like to warn you that I coded this website when I was 15 years old.  
I then had no professional knowledge I coded for myself just to learn and challenge myself.  
I invite you to view the video presentation of the site available at the address below that I carried out a project to finish in 2018.
